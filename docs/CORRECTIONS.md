# Corrections and deviations

Every place this build deviates from the original design doc / `PROMPT.md`, with the reason
and where the decision was taken. Per PROMPT.md ground rule #7 and CLAUDE.md working style:
we don't silently diverge.

## D1 — `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT.md` renamed to `PROMPT.md` (2026-08-06)

The build prompt shipped as `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT.md`; its own header and all references in
`CLAUDE.md` expect it at `PROMPT.md`. Renamed, no content change.

## D2 — Frontend and HTTP API deferred past Phase 1 (2026-08-06)

PROMPT.md M0 scaffolds backend + frontend together and its DoD includes `/api/health`.
Decision (user, plan approval 2026-08-06): Phase 1 targets calibration/backtesting, for which
`bwz` CLI + `make validate` suffice. The frontend and FastAPI layer land at M4 as specified.
`make dev`, `make types`, and `make docker` are no-op stubs until then.

## D3 — Milestone order: early validation slice before M4–M6 (2026-08-06)

PROMPT.md places validation at M7. Decision (user, plan approval): after M3 (single-chip
analysis) we immediately build the validation harness and fit calibration constants against
published single-chip reference points (H100, A100, MI300X). Multi-chip (M5) and the
DeepSeek-cluster backtest follow as the next phase. Rationale: backtesting accuracy is the
project's first deliverable of value; calibrating early catches modelling errors before they
propagate into the multi-chip layer.

## D4 — Samsung chip profiles deferred (2026-08-06)

Requested target vendors included Samsung. No Samsung datacenter accelerator has public
benchmarks rich enough to backtest against (mobile Exynos NPU data is too thin). Decision
(user): start with NVIDIA H100/A100 and AMD MI300X, revisit Samsung once the validation
harness exists.

## D5 — Flat roofline for v1; multi-level hierarchy deferred to M8 (2026-08-06)

M3 originally specified a hierarchical roofline (separate L1/SRAM, L2, DRAM ceilings, report which
level binds), and §3.2/§3.3 described Winograd/FFT conv selection and a ws/os/rs loop-order search.
Decision (user, 2026-08-06): v1 models one compute ridge (TOPS × achieved fraction) and one DRAM
ridge. The on-chip memory is a single tile buffer whose **capacity** constrains tile sizes — the
turnaround to HBM, the double-buffering depth, and the memory-vs-compute verdict all flow from
capacity, not from SRAM bandwidth. SRAM bandwidth is rarely published and rarely binds for
GEMM-shaped ops (tile AI 10–30 FLOP/byte vs a 100–500 FLOP/byte SRAM ridge). The deferred items are
preserved as an M8 refinement backlog, landed only on user demand and only if they improve
validation MAPE over the flat model.
