# Corrections and deviations

Every place this build deviates from the original design doc / `PROMPT.md`, with the reason
and where the decision was taken. Per PROMPT.md ground rule #7 and CLAUDE.md working style:
we don't silently diverge.

## D1 — `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT.md` renamed to `PROMPT.md` (2026-08-06)

The build prompt shipped as `CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT.md`; its own header and all references in
`CLAUDE.md` expect it at `PROMPT.md`. Renamed, no content change.

## D2 — Frontend and HTTP API deferred past Phase 1 (2026-08-06)

PROMPT.md M0 scaffolds backend + frontend together and its DoD includes `/api/health`.
Decision (user, plan approval 2026-08-06): Phase 1 targets calibration/backtesting, for which
`bwz` CLI + `make validate` suffice. The frontend and FastAPI layer land at M4 as specified.
`make dev`, `make types`, and `make docker` are no-op stubs until then.

## D3 — Milestone order: early validation slice before M4–M6 (2026-08-06)

PROMPT.md places validation at M7. Decision (user, plan approval): after M3 (single-chip
analysis) we immediately build the validation harness and fit calibration constants against
published single-chip reference points (H100, A100, MI300X). Multi-chip (M5) and the
DeepSeek-cluster backtest follow as the next phase. Rationale: backtesting accuracy is the
project's first deliverable of value; calibrating early catches modelling errors before they
propagate into the multi-chip layer.

## D4 — Samsung chip profiles deferred (2026-08-06)

Requested target vendors included Samsung. No Samsung datacenter accelerator has public
benchmarks rich enough to backtest against (mobile Exynos NPU data is too thin). Decision
(user): start with NVIDIA H100/A100 and AMD MI300X, revisit Samsung once the validation
harness exists.

## D5 — Flat roofline for v1; multi-level hierarchy deferred to M8 (2026-08-06)

M3 originally specified a hierarchical roofline (separate L1/SRAM, L2, DRAM ceilings, report which
level binds), and §3.2/§3.3 described Winograd/FFT conv selection and a ws/os/rs loop-order search.
Decision (user, 2026-08-06): v1 models one compute ridge (TOPS × achieved fraction) and one DRAM
ridge. The on-chip memory is a single tile buffer whose **capacity** constrains tile sizes — the
turnaround to HBM, the double-buffering depth, and the memory-vs-compute verdict all flow from
capacity, not from SRAM bandwidth. SRAM bandwidth is rarely published and rarely binds for
GEMM-shaped ops (tile AI 10–30 FLOP/byte vs a 100–500 FLOP/byte SRAM ridge). The deferred items are
preserved as an M8 refinement backlog, landed only on user demand and only if they improve
validation MAPE over the flat model.

## D5a — On-chip bandwidth promoted to a second ceiling (2026-08-07)

Supersedes D5's "on-chip memory contributes capacity only" clause. D5's reasoning — that SRAM
bandwidth rarely binds — was reached for datacenter parts that stream every weight from HBM. It is
false for an edge NPU large enough to hold the model on-die: when the resident fraction
`r = min(1, sram_bytes/W)` reaches 1, DRAM traffic goes to zero and on-chip bandwidth is the *only*
bandwidth term left.

v1 therefore models two bandwidth ceilings for weight traffic, per the user's supplied formulas:

```
t_dram   = (1 - r) * W / bw_dram
t_onchip = r * W / bw_onchip
t_token  = max(t_dram + t_kv, t_onchip, t_compute)     # double-buffered overlap, never a sum
```

The rest of D5 stands: one compute ridge, no L1/L2/L3 hierarchy, no loop-order search, no
Winograd/FFT.

## D5b — SRAM/NoC split and full-W SRAM accounting deferred (2026-08-07)

Two refinements to D5a were identified and **deliberately not taken** (user, 2026-08-07: "skip the
SRAM BW and keep the model simple"). Recorded here so the simplification is visible in every report
rather than forgotten:

1. **`bw_onchip` conflates two physical paths.** Local SRAM → PE array (weight feed) never crosses
   the NoC; the NoC carries inter-core activations and reductions. The supplied estimate of
   128 GB/s is a NoC bisection figure (1 Tbit/s ÷ 8), not an SRAM read bandwidth. A structural
   check on the array — 512×512 MACs at 0.8 GHz with the ÷8 bit-serial tax needs ≈51 GB/s per core,
   ≈205 GB/s SoC, merely not to starve — puts the true weight-feed path *above* the figure in use.
   Equivalently: at 128 GB/s the on-chip ridge is 1637 ops/byte, implying batch ≥ 819 to reach peak
   TOPS from SRAM, which is not a plausible design point.
2. **Streamed weights also pass through SRAM.** Non-resident weights land in an SRAM staging buffer
   and are then read by the array, so SRAM carries `W` reads + `(1-r)·W` writes, not `r·W`.

Consequence, quantified so the risk is bounded rather than hand-waved. Margin before `t_onchip`
overtakes the binding term, under the model as implemented:

| config | binding term | margin |
|---|---|---|
| chip_a 4B / 2B / 1B decode | DRAM | 260× |
| chip_b 4B decode | DRAM | 11× |
| chip_b 2B decode | DRAM | 3.8× |
| **chip_b 1B decode** | **on-chip** | **binding** |
| all prefill TTFT @ S=512, crossover S\* | DRAM / compute | large |

So exactly one cell of the head-to-head matrix is a direct readout of `bw_onchip`, and it is the
cell whose input is least defensible. Reports must carry this; see the flip-margin requirement in
`docs/PLAN.md` Session 4. Under the deferred accounting (2) the margins shrink to 1.9× / 1.6× /
1.26×, which would move several decode figures by ~25% — the refinement is not cosmetic, only
deferred. Trigger to land it: a published SRAM organization (banks × width × clock) or a measured
figure for either chip.

## D6 — Per-chip empirical fields live in the profile; defaults in `calibration.py` (2026-08-07)

CLAUDE.md #2 requires every empirical constant to live in `calibration.py`, but PROMPT.md §4.1 puts
`usable_memory_fraction` and `kernel_launch_overhead_s` in the chip profile. Both are right for
different reasons: the constant is per-chip, but an unsourced one is exactly what CLAUDE.md #2
exists to prevent. Rule adopted (build decision): a profile **may** carry a per-chip value **only**
with a source or an `estimates:` entry; when omitted, the value comes from `calibration.py`. The
"no inline magic numbers" ban is unchanged — a bare literal in `analysis/` or `operators/` is still
a review failure.

## D7 — Hypothetical and estimated profile fields declare themselves (2026-08-07)

CLAUDE.md forbids committing profile YAML without a `source_url`. Two shipped profiles cannot
satisfy it as written: `chip_b` is a hypothetical variant with no datasheet, and several `chip_a`
fields are engineering estimates rather than published figures. Rather than weaken the rule, the
schema gains two declarations (build decision):

- `hypothetical: true` + `derived_from: <chip_id>` — profile is not a product. Flagged in
  `bwz list` and in every report it appears in.
- `estimates: {<field>: <rationale>}` — per-field provenance for values that are estimated rather
  than sourced. The loader propagates every *touched* estimate into `report.assumptions`, so a
  report states which of its inputs were guessed and why.

`source_url` stays mandatory for any profile claiming to describe a real product.

## D8 — Edge-NPU worked example adopted as the M3 acceptance demo (2026-08-07)

The user supplied a complete two-chip INT8 edge-NPU comparison (residency-weighted weight traffic,
prefill/decode split, per-op layer table, chip-vs-chip crossover). Decision (user, 2026-08-07):
**additive** — the milestone structure is unchanged, and this example becomes M3's integration
snapshot. `chip_a` and `chip_b` join the M1 chip roster; H100/A100/MI300X still carry the Session 5
calibration, because they are the only profiles with published numbers to fit shared constants
against. `chip_a`/`chip_b` inherit those constants and are explicitly uncalibrated.

Deviations from the spec as supplied, with reasons:

- **`chip_a.sram_bytes` corrected to ≈55 MB.** The supplied 5210241024 (5.21 GB) yields `r = 100%`
  for a 3.9 GB model, contradicting the stated residencies. 55 MB reproduces all three
  (1.4% / 2.7% / 5.5% at 4B / 2B / 1B) and all six decode figures, plus the KV@4k case
  (117.3 ms, 8.5 tok/s) to within 1%. Carried as an `estimates:` entry.
- **Prefill attention FLOPs halved for causal masking.** The supplied
  `n_layers·4·d_model·S²` counts the full score matrix; a causal decoder computes half of it.
  Effect on TTFT is small (0.2 ms of 19.5 at S=512) but it shifts the crossover, which is where a
  golden sits.
- **Crossover goldens re-derived from the implementation.** The supplied `S* ≈ 759` (4B) does not
  follow from the supplied inputs; they give ≈735, or ≈745 with the causal fix. Both are outside
  the stated ±2%. The implementation's value is pinned instead of asserting a number the formulas
  do not produce.
- **Prefill ignores KV writes to DRAM** (≈4 ms at S=4096 for the 4B). Small, but stated as an
  assumption rather than silently absent.

The supplied ~2% assertions are **self-consistency goldens** derived from `[EST]` inputs, not
measurements. They live in `tests/unit/` and an integration snapshot — never in
`tests/validation/` or `docs/CALIBRATION.md`, which are reserved for published, citable reference
points. Keeping that line sharp is what makes the Session 5 calibration mean anything.

## D9 — `gemma4` profile replaced by `gemma3_4b` (2026-08-07)

Commit 5218046 named `gemma4.yaml` in the Phase 1 plan (no profile was written — `profiles/models/`
is still empty). No public `config.json` exists under that name, and CLAUDE.md forbids inventing
hyperparameters. Decision (user, 2026-08-07): ship Gemma-3-4B, which has a published config and is
the basis of the D8 worked example.

**Open:** the user's figures are an idealized Gemma-3-4B (Q projection at `d_model×d_model`,
`d_kv=512`, vocab 256000), whereas the real config has 8 query heads × 256 head-dim, vocab 262144,
and interleaved local/global attention. Using the true config shifts the 94.4 MB/layer golden.
Default plan is to ship both — `gemma3_4b_idealized` so the D8 goldens hold exactly, and
`gemma3_4b` from the HF config — so the cost of the simplification is visible. Awaiting user
confirmation; not blocking M1.
